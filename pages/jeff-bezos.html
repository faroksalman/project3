			<h1>Jeff-Bezos</h1>
			<p>
				Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon, the world's largest online retailer,
				according to the company's 2022 proxy statement.
			</p>
			<p>
				He also owns space exploration company Blue Origin, which is included at
				Bloomberg's calculation of investment cost
			</p>
			<p>
				Determining a valuation for Blue Origin is difficult because of its
				unique strategy and the fact that Bezos is the sole shareholder with no
				apparent intent to sell, according to Chad Anderson, CEO of venture fund
				Space Angels. A Blue Origin director said at a 2014 space conference in
				Washington that the billionaire had invested "at least $500 million,"
				which is accounted for in equal amounts over 13 years beginning in 2001,
				the year Blue Origin was incorporated.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bezos said in April 2017 that he funds the enterprise through the sale
				of "about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock." That amount is deducted
				from the after-tax proceeds of his known share sales from 2014 and
				categorized as funding for Blue Origin. That amount was assumed to be $2
				billion in 2021 as the company performed its first human-crewed flights
				and Bezos's share sales accelerated. Since 2002, he's sold about $29
				billion worth of Amazon shares, based on an analysis of Bloomberg data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bezos paid $250 million for the Washington Post in August 2013, which is
				included at cost.
			</p>
			<p>
				He committed $2 billion to social issues in 2018 and made a pledge in
				February 2020 to donate $10 billion to help counter the effects of
				climate change. These amounts will be deducted from his net worth when
				gifts are made.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value of his cash investments includes these transactions, taxes and
				market performance. Bezos held 16% of Amazon before a 4% stake was
				transferred to MacKenzie Scott in 2019 following the pair's divorce.
				About $650 million was deducted from the cash balance at this time to
				reflect Bloomberg's estimate of the cost of his divorce outside of
				Amazon shares.
			</p>
			<p
				>Drew Herdener, a spokesman for Amazon, declined to comment on Bezos's
				net worth.

			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<div>
				<img src="../media/Jeff-Bezos.webp" alt="" />
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Birthdate:</strong> 1/12/1964</li>
				<li><strong>Family:</strong> Divorced, 4 children</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Education:</strong> Princeton University, Princeton University
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Jeff Bezos is a former Wall Street computer engineer who created Amazon
				in 1994 to sell books online. After an initial public offering in 1997,
				Amazon stock shot up almost 40-fold, sending Bezos's personal fortune
				above $12 billion. By the time the technology bubble had finished
				deflating in 2001, his shares were valued at less than $2 billion.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Princeton graduate built his reputation on long-term thinking and
				focusing on customer service. Today, Amazon sells millions of different
				products, many of which are purveyed by third-party vendors that rely on
				Amazon's data management services to help fulfill their orders.
			</p>
			<p>
				The company introduced the Kindle electronic book reader in 2007. It's
				now Amazon's biggest-selling item. Four years later, Amazon released the
				Kindle Fire, putting the company in competition with Apple in the tablet
				computer business.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bezos owns the Washington Post and also oversees Blue Origin, a space
				exploration company that seeks to lower the cost and increase the safety
				of spaceflight. He pledged $2 billion of his fortune toward preschool
				programs and support for homeless families in September 2018, and $10
				billion to fighting climate change in February 2020.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bezos and his wife MacKenzie divorced in 2019. MacKenzie received a 4%
				stake in Amazon as part of their separation.
			</p>
			<p>
				He announced in February 2021 that he would retire as chief executive of
				Amazon, with plans to devote more time to his philanthropy and other
				companies. In July 2021 he joined Blue Origin's first crewed mission.
