			<h1>Bernard Arnault</h1>
			<p>
				The majority of Arnault's fortune is derived from a 97.5% stake in
				Christian Dior, the luxury fashion house. He holds the shares through
				entities associated with Groupe Familial Arnault, according to Dior's
				2020 annual report. Bernard Arnault is credited with all shares held by
				the family holding company in Dior, as well its other holdings, to
				reflect his status as founder and patriarch.
			</p>
			<p>
				Christian Dior controls 41.2% of LVMH, the world's largest luxury-goods
				maker, according to Dior's 2020 annual report. These shares aren't
				included in the analysis because the value is already captured. The
				family holds an additional 6.2% of LVMH, according to its 2020
				registration document, and these shares are included in the net wealth
				calculation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Liabilities in the analysis include debts held by Arnault's family
				holding company, associated with the purchase and restructuring on
				public shareholdings. The value of his cash holdings is based on an
				analysis of dividends, market performance, insider transactions, taxes
				and charitable contributions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Molly Morse, a spokeswoman for Arnault at Kekst & Co., said the
				billionaire declined to comment on his net worth calculation.

			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<div>
				<img src="../media/Bernard-Arnault.webp" alt="" />
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Birthdate:</strong> 3/5/1949</li>
				<li><strong>Family:</strong> Married, 5 children</li>
				<li> <strong>Education:</strong> Ecole Polytechnique </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Bernard Arnault was born in the northern French town of Roubaix in 1949.
				After graduating with an engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique in
				Paris, he joined his family's company and persuaded his father to exit
				its construction business and focus on real estate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Arnault entered the luxury goods market in 1984, when he took over the
				bankrupt textile group that owned Christian Dior. He sold all of the
				company's other businesses and used the proceeds to buy a controlling
				stake in LVMH. Other acquisitions include Fendi, TAG Heuer and Bulgari.
				He sought and failed to buy auction house Sotheby's and retailer Gucci,
				which he lost to rival billionaire Francois Pinault in 2010.
			</p>
			<p>
				LVMH agreed to relinquish its 23 percent stake in Hermes to its
				shareholders in September 2014, ending a four-year battle to gain
				control of the luxury label. He remained its biggest individual
				shareholder until July 2017, when he sold most of his shares as part of
				a $13.2 billion deal to consolidate his control of Christian Dior.
			</p>
			<p>
				The billionaire lives on Paris's Left Bank with his second wife, concert
				pianist Helene Mercier. His art collection of modern and contemporary
				paintings includes pieces by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst,
				Maurizio Cattelan, Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso.
			</p>
			<p>
				Arnault sparked a debate over taxation in France in 2012 when Belgium's
				government disclosed that he was seeking to become a Belgian citizen.
				Arnault said he intended to still pay taxes in France. His request was
				aimed at safeguarding a foundation he'd established in Belgium to
				"protect the financial interests and wealth" of his heirs. In April
				2013, he withdrew his application as "a gesture of my attachment to
				France and my faith in its future."
