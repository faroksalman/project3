			<h1>Sergey Brin</h1>
			<p>
				Musk is CEO of publicly traded Tesla, which is the world's most valuable
				carmaker, and closely held rocket business SpaceX, which counts the U.S.
				National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a client.
			</p>
			<p>
				Musk owns about 17% of Tesla, according to a February 2021 regulatory
				filing.
			</p>
			<p>
				He also holds about 59 million exercisable options to buy Tesla shares,
				according to a Bloomberg analysis, which are included at their net
				value.
			</p>
			<p>
				SpaceX is valued using an October 2021 funding round that valued the
				company at $100 billion. A Nov. 15, 2016, filing with the Federal
				Communications Commission showed Musk owned 54% of the closely held
				company through a trust. Bloomberg's analysis assumes he didn't sell
				shares in subsequent rounds and that his stake has been diluted to about
				47% in proportion to the amount raised. The value is reduced by 15% to
				account for typical discounts that shares in unicorns attract on the
				secondary market, according to two brokers.
			</p>
			<p>
				He also owns 9.1% of Twitter, a stake he began to acquire in February
				2022.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value of his cash holdings includes proceeds from his insider
				transactions and is adjusted to reflect taxes, market performance, and
				charitable giving.
			</p>
			<p>
				About half of Musk's Tesla shares were pledged as collateral to secure
				personal indebtedness, according to the company's 2021 proxy statement.
				The maximum loan allowable under this arrangement could be no more than
				25% of the value of those shares, according to the filing. Musk said in
				December 2019 that some of his SpaceX shares were also pledged, without
				providing further details. A liability of $20.2 billion is included in
				the analysis to reflect calculated pledges of Tesla and SpaceX shares.
				This liability was recalculated in December 2021, resulting in a $9.6
				billion decrease in his net worth.
			</p>
			<p>His investment in tunneling venture Boring Co. is valued at cost.</p>

			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<div>
				<img src="../media/sergey.webp" alt="" />
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Birthdate:</strong> 6/28/1971</li>
				<li><strong>Family:</strong> Single, 7 children</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Education:</strong> University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School
					of the University of Pennsylvania
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Born in South Africa to an engineer father and nutritionist mother, Musk
				left home as a 17-year-old for college in Canada, in part to avoid
				serving in the apartheid-era South African army. After graduating from
				the University of Pennsylvania with degrees in physics and economics, he
				enrolled at Stanford University. He dropped out after his first few days
				to pursue his three main areas of interest: the Internet, clean energy
				and space.
			</p>
			<p>
				He created an online publishing platform called Zip2 in 1995 and sold it
				four years later for more than $300 million. He reinvested some of the
				proceeds to start X.com, an online payment system. He would merge that
				with what eventually became PayPal, the e-commerce site that was
				ultimately sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.
			</p>
			<p>
				His next project: SpaceX, a closely held rocket company that was tapped
				by NASA to take over space shuttle's role of resupplying the
				International Space Station. A year later, he co-founded Tesla, the that
				produced the world's first all-electric, zero-emission sports car in
				2010. In the same year the company sold shares in a public offering.
			</p>
			<p>
				His third company, SolarCity, was a provider of solar power systems.
				SolarCity sold shares in a public offering in 2012 and was bought by
				Tesla on Nov. 21, 2016.
			</p>
			<p>
				Musk, who has said he intends to retire on planet Mars, joined Warren
				Buffett's Giving Pledge in April 2012.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tesla became the world's most valuable carmaker in July 2020 and further
				gains led to Musk becoming the world's richest person in January 2021.
				He announced in October 2021 that Tesla would move its headquarters from
				Palo Alto, California to Austin, Texas.
